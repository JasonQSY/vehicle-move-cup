# Vehicle-Move-Cup

## Introduction

As a UM-SJTU JI student, this is my project 1 in Vg100 Introduction to Engineering course (2016 Summer). Since I am resposible for circuit and programming, I create this repo and put everything in it. It will be more convenient for people who read the manual to copy, use, modify and redistribute the script and circuit diagram.

## Circuit diagram

The diagram is completed by fritizing under `./circuit`.

## Script

The script is programmed by Arduino under `./move-cup`. Some test file that may be useful is under `./testFile`.

## LICENCE

The whole repo is under MIT LICENCE. Feel free to copy, use and modify it.
